### Monitoring
- Application logs via console
- Health check endpoint for uptime monitoring
- Error tracking and reporting

### Troubleshooting

#### Database Connection Issues
- Verify DATABASE_URL format
- Check database server accessibility
- Ensure SSL is properly configured for production

#### Build Failures
- Check Node.js version (requires Node 20+)
- Verify all dependencies are properly installed
- Review build logs for specific errors

#### Runtime Errors
- Check environment variables are set
- Review application logs
- Verify database migrations have run

### Support
For technical support, check the application logs and health endpoint first. The application automatically falls back to in-memory storage if database connection fails.
